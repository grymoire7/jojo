## Explanation

JoJo is a Job Search Management System. It's a Ruby CLI that takes a generic
resume, additional work history data, and a job description as input and
produces not only a tailored resume and cover letter but also a comprehensive
website with landing page selling a single product (you) to a single customer
(the employer).
