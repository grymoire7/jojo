## Tips for Choosing Recommendations

- **Recent is better**: Prioritize recommendations from the last 2-3 years
- **Specific over generic**: "Delivered X project ahead of schedule" beats "hard worker"
- **Relevant skills**: Match recommendations to the types of roles you're seeking
- **Diverse perspectives**: Include managers, peers, and direct reports if possible
- **Achievement-focused**: Best recommendations cite concrete results

## Optional: Add Headshots (Future Feature)

In a future version, you'll be able to add headshot images for recommenders.
For now, focus on the text content.
